## Python libraries

* [**D47crunch**](https://github.com/mdaeron/D47crunch): a Python library for processing and standardizing carbonate clumped-isotope analyses, from low-level data out of a dual-inlet mass spectrometer to final, “absolute” Δ<sub>47</sub> and Δ<sub>48</sub> values with fully propagated analytical error estimates.
