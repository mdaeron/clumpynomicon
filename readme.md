# Clumpynomicon

A collection of resources related to clumped isotope geochemistry and closely related fields. Inspired by many other [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) collections.

Links are ordered by date of first public release.

## Python libraries

* [**D47crunch**](https://github.com/mdaeron/D47crunch): a Python library for processing and standardizing carbonate clumped-isotope analyses, from low-level data out of a dual-inlet mass spectrometer to final, “absolute” Δ<sub>47</sub> and Δ<sub>48</sub> values with fully propagated analytical error estimates.

* [**D47calib**](https://github.com/mdaeron/D47calib): Generate, combine, display and apply Δ47 calibrations based on Omnivariant Generalized Least Squares.


## R libraries

* [**clumpedr**](https://github.com/isoverse/clumpedr): Clumped isotope data analysis in R.
